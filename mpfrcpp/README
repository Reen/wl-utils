1. To use already built MPFRCPP you should include ``mpfrcpp.hpp'' *ONLY*.

2. You should have the initialization/*.cpp files compiled (as a
   static library) as well as GMP and MPFR libraries.

   initialization/*.cpp files define global objects and you could drop
   them.

3. If you want to get MPFRCPP without pre-defined global objects, include
   <mpfrcpp/mpfrcpp_uninitialized.hpp>.
